# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub's
["Report a vulnerability"](https://github.com/shipsolid/repo-policy/security/advisories/new)
form rather than opening a public issue. We'll acknowledge within 5 business days.

## Scope

`repo-policy` requires a GitHub token with `repo` (or fine-grained `administration:write`)
permissions to manage branch protection and rulesets. Treat that token with the same care as any
credential capable of changing repository security settings. The tool never stores the token —
it is read once per invocation from `--token`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `GH_TOKEN`.
